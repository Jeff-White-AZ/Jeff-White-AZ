- ⚡ Fun fact: I wrote my first code at Harvard in 1974 or so. My first computer-related job was to search anthropological publications for references to plants that people used to affect human fertility. My first real programming work was done with SAS using punch cards at a research center near Cali, Colombia. Our SAS commands and data were transmitted via phone line to Bogota. Output was on a line-printer in the standard fan-fold, wide format of the time.
